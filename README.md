A Java console-based application developed to compare the performance of three sorting algorithms â€” **Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.**

The system allows users to manually input or randomly generate datasets, then sorts them using different algorithms while tracking execution time and operation steps.

## Features include:

Menu-driven interface for easy user interaction

Implementation of Bubble, Merge, and Quick Sort algorithms

Step count and time measurement for each sorting method

Comparison table showing algorithm efficiency

Collaborative group project with 4 members

## ðŸ§© Technologies Used

- **Language:** Java  
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub 

## ðŸ§© Member Roles:

Member 1 â€“ Bubble Sort implementation

Member 2 â€“ Merge Sort implementation

Member 3 â€“ Quick Sort implementation

Member 4 â€“ Data generation, performance comparison, and user interface


ðŸ“š Objective: Demonstrate understanding of algorithmic complexity and performance evaluation using Java.
